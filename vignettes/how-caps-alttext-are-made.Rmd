# How captions and alternative text are generated

If you create tables and/or figures with this package, you will notice that captions and alternative text will be automatically generated. This vignette explains how these texts are created.

## Templates

The ['captions_alt_text_template.csv' file](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/inst/resources/captions_alt_text_template.csv) contains the templates for each table or figure's caption/alternative text. Tables have captions, and figures have captions and alternative text. Please refer to [the `asar` package's accessibility vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html) to learn more about how we aimed to construct clear and comprehensive alternative text.

As *templates*, these texts are the *starting point* for the final captions and alternative text (again, we encourage users to read the [the `asar` package's accessibility vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html) to learn how and why they should check the accuracy and write the final component of each figure's alternative text). Specifically, there are placeholders throughout the texts (e.g., B.ref.pt, B.min, B.max). If the model results are parsed successfully, these placeholders will eventually be replaced with key quantities from the model results. For example, B.ref.pt will be replaced with the biomass figure's reference point, and B.min and B.max will be replaced with the minimum and maximum biomass.

The file is set up like this:

-   Column 1 ("label") is a shorthand label for your figure or table. Labels are somewhat short and exclude spaces. Examples include "kobe", "relative.biomass", and "fishing.mortality".
-   Column 2 ("type") contains "figure" or "table".
-   Column 3 ("caption") contains the caption.
-   Column 4 ("alt_text") contains alternative text for figures. For tables, this column is blank.

+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| label       | type       | caption                     | alt_text                             |
+=============+============+=============================+======================================+
| example_fig | figure     | Example caption for figure. | Example alternative text for figure. |
+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| example_tab | table      | Example caption for table.  |                                      |
+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------+

## Extracting key quantities from model results

Next, key quantities are extracted from the model results that have already been converted into a standardized format using `asar::convert_output()`. Key quantities replace the placeholders using two successive functions: [`write_captions()`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/R/write_captions.R) and [`add_more_key_quants()`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/00c02487c9dbceaddb43257abdee72594f17b076/R/utils.R#L7).

### `write_captions()`

In this function, the captions_alt_text_template.csv file is imported as a dataframe. Then, key quantities are extracted from the model results and substituted into the dataframe's appropriate placeholders. Finally, the function exports the updated dataframe as a new csv ("captions_alt_text.csv").

### `add_more_key_quants()`

This function, which is located in the [utils.R file](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/R/utils.R), imports the new captions_alt_text.csv as a dataframe, then substitutes some placeholders with key quantities that cannot be extracted from the model results because they are manually specified by the user, or are derived using such quantities (e.g., a figure's end year, units, reference point, and more). The function exports the dataframe by overwriting the csv with the same filename.

## Connecting the tables & figures with the captions & alternative text

Lastly, the [`extract_caps_alttext`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/R/extract_caps_alttext.R) function selects the appropriate captions and alternative text from captions_alt_text.csv when a figure or table is being plotted with the argument `make_rda = TRUE`. The [`export_rda`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr/blob/main/R/export_rda.R) function exports an rda containing 1) a table and caption, or 2) a figure, caption, and alternative text.
