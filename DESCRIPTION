Description: Creates exploratory and finished tables and figures for stock
    assessment documents from U.S. stock assessment model outputs. This
    packages addresses parts of the stock assessment workflow that
    interprets outputs of stock assessment models as well as allows the
    analyst to create report ready tables and figures, reducing the need
    to create their own and format then when adding into a report. This
    package is intended to be used in conjuction with `asar`, a partially
    automated template for writing various stock assessment reports.
    Throughout development, we will be creating a set of standardized
    figures and tables for a stock assessment report, developing functions
    to produce a variety of diagonostic plots, and other helpful
    materials. The advantage of using this package over others is that it
    applies to a range of stock assessment model outputs and standardizes
    them.
