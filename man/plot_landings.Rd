\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame returned from `asar::convert_output()`.}

\item{unit_label}{indicate the name of the units of landings as to label the axis}

\item{end_year}{last year of assessment}

\item{make_rda}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether to produce an .rda file containing
a list with the figure/table, caption, and alternative text (if figure). If TRUE,
the .rda will be exported to the folder indicated in the argument "rda_dir".
Default is FALSE.}

\item{rda_dir}{The location of the folder containing the generated .rda files
("rda_files") that will be created if the argument `make_rda` = TRUE.
Default is the working directory.}

\item{fleet_names}{Indicate the full names of the fleet that will be used in
the plot legend. Format should follow
c("fleet_name_in_model" = "Desired Fleet Name")}
}
\value{
Create a plot ready for a stock assessment report of cumulative landings
over time by fleet.Includes options to plot by fleet, total observed landings
with and without predicted landings. Indicate if fleet should be faceted or on one plot (default). Warning: i
