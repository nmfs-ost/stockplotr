\usage{
plot_spawn_recruitment(
  dat,
  spawning_biomass_label = "mt",
  recruitment_label = "mt",
  interactive = TRUE,
  module = NULL,
  scale_amount = 1,
  make_rda = FALSE,
  figures_dir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame or names list of data frames returned from
\link[asar]{convert_output}. The first data frame in the list is used in
calculation of a reference line if one is present}

\item{spawning_biomass_label}{Units for spawning biomass}

\item{recruitment_label}{units for recruitment}

\item{interactive}{Indicate whether the environment the
plot is being made in is interactive. By default, this
is set to false. If true, dependent on your data, a
option menu will pop-up.}

\item{module}{(Optional) A string indicating the linked module_name associated
with the label for the plot if known. Default is NULL. By default, the function
will select the most relevant module if more than 1 exists.}

\item{scale_amount}{A number describing how much to scale down the quantities
shown on the y axis. For example, scale_amount = 100 would scale down a value
from 500,000 --> 5,000. This scale will be reflected in the y axis label.}

\item{make_rda}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether to produce an .rda file containing
a list with the figure/table, caption, and alternative text (if figure). If TRUE,
the rda will be exported to the folder indicated in the argument "figures_dir".
Default is FALSE.}

\item{figures_dir}{The location of the folder containing the generated figure
rda files ("figures") that will be created if the argument `make_rda` = TRUE.
Default is the working directory.}
}
\value{
Plot the spawn recruitment relationship  from an assessment model output file
translated to a standardized output (\link[asar]{convert_output}). There are options to return a
[ggplot2::ggplot()] object or export an rda object containing associated
caption and alternative text for the figure.
