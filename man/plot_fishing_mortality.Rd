\usage{
plot_fishing_mortality(
  dat,
  geom = "line",
  group = NULL,
  facet = NULL,
  ref_line = "msy",
  era = "time",
  module = NULL,
  relative = FALSE,
  make_rda = FALSE,
  figures_dir = getwd(),
  interactive = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame or names list of data frames returned from
\link[asar]{convert_output}. The first data frame in the list is used in
calculation of a reference line if one is present}

\item{geom}{A string stating the geom used for the plot. Default is "line".
Options include "line", "point", or "area"}

\item{group}{a string of a single column that groups the data (e.g. "fleet",
"sex", "area", etc.). Currently can only have one level of grouping.}

\item{facet}{a string or vector of strings of a column that facets the data
(e.g. "year", "area", etc.)}

\item{ref_line}{A string specifying the type of reference you want to
compare spawning biomass to. The default is `"target"`, which looks for
`"spawning_biomass_target"` in the `"label"` column of `dat`. The actual
searching in `dat` is case agnostic and will work with either upper- or
lower-case letters but you must use one of the options specified in the
default list to ensure that the label on the figure looks correct
regardless of how it is specified in `dat`.}

\item{era}{a string naming the era of data such as historical ("early"), current ("time"), or 
projected ("fore") data if filtering should occur. Default is set to "time" which is 
the current time. To plot all data, set era to NULL.}

\item{module}{(Optional) A string indicating the linked module_name associated
with the label for the plot if known. Default is NULL. By default, the function
will select the most relevant module if more than 1 exists.}

\item{relative}{A logical value specifying if the resulting figures should
be relative spawning biomass. The default is `FALSE`. `ref_line` indicates
which reference point to use.}

\item{make_rda}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether to produce an .rda file containing
a list with the figure/table, caption, and alternative text (if figure). If TRUE,
the rda will be exported to the folder indicated in the argument "figures_dir".
Default is FALSE.}

\item{figures_dir}{The location of the folder containing the generated figure
rda files ("figures") that will be created if the argument `make_rda` = TRUE.
Default is the working directory.}

\item{interactive}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether the environment in which the
function is operating  is interactive. This bypasses some options for
filtering when preparing data for the plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Arguments called from ggplot2::geom_line or ggplot2::geom_point}
}
\value{
Create a plot ready for a stock assessment report of fishing mortality over time 
from the results of an assessment model translated to the a standardized output 
(\link[asar]{convert_output}). Includes options to group or facet data where available.
There are options to return a
[ggplot2::ggplot()] object or export an rda object containing associated
caption and alternative text for the figure.
