\usage{
plot_biomass(
  dat,
  geom = "line",
  group = NULL,
  facet = NULL,
  ref_line = "msy",
  unit_label = "metric tons",
  module = NULL,
  scale_amount = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame or names list of data frames returned from
\link[asar]{convert_output}. The first data frame in the list is used in
calculation of a reference line if one is present}

\item{geom}{A string stating the geom used for the plot. Default is "line".
Options include "line", "point", or "area"}

\item{group}{a string of a single column that groups the data (e.g. "fleet",
"sex", "area", etc.). Currently can only have one level of grouping.}

\item{facet}{a string or vector of strings of a column that facets the data
(e.g. "year", "area", etc.)}

\item{ref_line}{A string specifying the type of reference you want to
compare biomass to. The default is `"msy"`, which looks for
`"biomass_msy"` in the `"label"` column of `dat`. The actual
searching in `dat` is case agnostic and will work with either upper- or
lower-case letters but you must use one of the options specified in the
default list to ensure that the label on the figure looks correct
regardless of how it is specified in `dat`. Other possibilities may include
"target", "MSY", and "unfished".}

\item{unit_label}{units for biomass}

\item{module}{(Optional) A string indicating the linked module_name associated
with the label for the plot if known. Default is NULL. By default, the function
will select the most relevant module if more than 1 exists.}

\item{scale_amount}{A number describing how much to scale down the quantities
shown on the y axis. For example, scale_amount = 100 would scale down a value
from 500,000 --> 5,000. This scale will be reflected in the y axis label.}

\item{relative}{A logical value specifying if the resulting figures should
be relative spawning biomass. The default is `FALSE`. `ref_line` indicates
which reference point to use.}

\item{make_rda}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether to produce an .rda file containing
a list with the figure/table, caption, and alternative text (if figure). If TRUE,
the rda will be exported to the folder indicated in the argument "figures_dir".
Default is FALSE.}

\item{figures_dir}{The location of the folder containing the generated figure
rda files ("figures") that will be created if the argument `make_rda` = TRUE.
Default is the working directory.}

\item{interactive}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether the environment in which the
function is operating  is interactive. This bypasses some options for
filtering when preparing data for the plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Arguments called from ggplot2::geom_line or ggplot2::geom_point}
}
\value{
Plot total biomass from a stock assessment model as found in a NOAA
stock assessment report. Units of total biomass can either be manually added
or will be extracted from the provided file if possible. There are options #' to return a [ggplot2::ggplot()] object or export an rda object containing
associated caption and alternative text for the figure.
