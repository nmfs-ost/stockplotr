\usage{
plot_biomass_at_age(
  dat,
  unit_label = "metric tons",
  scale_amount = 1,
  end_year = NULL,
  make_rda = FALSE,
  figures_dir = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data frame returned from \link[asar]{convert_output}}

\item{unit_label}{units for recruitment}

\item{scale_amount}{A number describing how much to scale down the biomass at
age. For example, scale_amount = 100 would scale down a value
from 500,000 --> 5,000. This scale will be reflected in the legend label.}

\item{end_year}{last year of assessment}

\item{make_rda}{TRUE/FALSE; indicate whether to produce an .rda file containing
a list with the figure/table, caption, and alternative text (if figure). If TRUE,
the rda will be exported to the folder indicated in the argument "figures_dir".
Default is FALSE.}

\item{figures_dir}{The location of the folder containing the generated figure
rda files ("figures") that will be created if the argument `make_rda` = TRUE.
Default is the working directory.}
}
\value{
Plot total biomass at age from a stock assessment model as found in a NOAA
stock assessment report. Units of total biomass can either be manually added
or will be extracted from the provided file if possible.
